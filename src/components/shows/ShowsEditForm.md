# ShowsEditForm Component Explanation

### Purpose:

The `ShowsEditForm` component is responsible for rendering a form used to edit and update details of a specific show.

### Imports:

- `useState` and `useEffect` from `react`: Imported React hooks for managing state and side effects.
- `useNavigate` and `useParams` from `react-router-dom`: Navigation-related hooks for handling navigation and accessing URL parameters.
- `"./ShowsForm.css"`: Imports CSS styles for the ShowsEditForm component.
- `getOneShow` from `"../../api/fetch"`: Function used to fetch details of a single show.

### State and Constants:

- `URL`: Constant storing the base API URL for making requests.
- `show`: State variable initialized using `useState` to manage show details, with default empty values.

### Functions:

- `handleSubmit(event)`: Function invoked on form submission. Sends a PUT request to update show details.
- `handleTextChange(event)`: Function handling input changes, updating the corresponding property in the 'show' state.

### useEffect:

- Fetches the details of a specific show based on the 'id' parameter using `getOneShow`.
- Updates the 'show' state with the fetched data, executed when the 'id' parameter changes.

### Rendered Content:

- `<form>` element: Wraps the form inputs, listens for submission, and triggers `handleSubmit` on submission.
- Input fields for various show properties:
  - Each input field is associated with a label and an `onChange` event handler.
  - The `value` attribute is bound to the corresponding property in the 'show' state.
  - When the input value changes, `handleTextChange` updates the state with the new value.
- `<input type="submit">`: Renders a submit button to submit the form.

### Purpose of Rendered Content:

This component presents a form for users to modify and save the details of a specific show. It fetches the current show details, populates the form fields with this data, allows users to make changes, and submits the updated information to the server.
