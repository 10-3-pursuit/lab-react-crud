- `<img src={hero} alt="film" />`: Displays the hero image with the `alt` attribute set to "film" as alternate text for screen readers or in case the image fails to load.
- `<p>` tag with photo credits: Provides credits for the image using anchor tags that link to the photographer's Unsplash profile.

### Purpose of Rendered Content:
