## Why is useNavigate needed?

`useNavigate` from "react-router-dom" is used as a hook to navigate programmatically in a React application. It is particularly relevant in the context of form submission and handling the response of that submission. Let's break down its usage:

1. **Importing `useNavigate`:** `useNavigate` is imported from "react-router-dom", which is a standard library for routing in React applications.

2. **Creating `navigate` Instance:** Inside the `ShowsForm` component, `const navigate = useNavigate();` creates an instance of `useNavigate`. This instance, `navigate`, can be called to navigate to different routes programmatically.

3. **Using `navigate` in `handleSubmit`:** In the `handleSubmit` function, which is triggered when the form is submitted, a POST request is made to an API. After the API responds successfully, `navigate` is used to redirect the user to a new route. This is seen in the following line:
   
   ```javascript
   navigate(`/shows/${response.id}`);
   ```
   Here, after a show is successfully added (indicated by a successful API response), the user is navigated to a new page that presumably shows the details of the show just added. The `${response.id}` part dynamically constructs the URL using the ID returned from the API response.

In summary, `useNavigate` in both `ShowsNewForm` and `MoviesNewForm` component is used to direct the user to a new page upon successful completion of a form submission. This enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback and navigation to a relevant page, such as a detail view of the item just created.

## What is the purpose of each useState used in ShowsIndex.jsx?

The `useState` hooks in the `ShowsIndex` component serve various purposes, each catering to a different aspect of the component's functionality and user interface. Here's a breakdown of each `useState` and its relevance:

1. **`const [shows, setShows] = useState([]);`**
   - **Purpose:** This state holds the list of shows to be displayed. It can change based on user interactions, such as searching.
   - **Usage:** Initially, it's set to an empty array and later populated with the list of shows fetched from the API. When a user searches for a show, this state is updated to only include shows that match the search criteria.
   - **Why Needed:** It's essential for dynamically updating the list of shows displayed on the UI. Without this state, the component wouldn't be able to reactively display shows based on user actions like searching.

2. **`const [loadingError, setLoadingError] = useState(false);`**
   - **Purpose:** This state tracks whether an error occurred during the data fetching process.
   - **Usage:** It is initially set to `false`, indicating no error. If an error occurs during the fetch operation in the `useEffect` hook, this state is set to `true`.
   - **Why Needed:** This state allows the component to conditionally render different UI elements based on whether an error occurred. For instance, it shows an error message if `loadingError` is `true`.

3. **`const [allShows, setAllShows] = useState([]);`**
   - **Purpose:** This state holds the original unfiltered list of all shows fetched from the API.
   - **Usage:** It's used as a reference for the search functionality. When a search is performed, `allShows` is filtered to create a new list that updates the `shows` state.
   - **Why Needed:** This state is crucial for preserving the original list of shows. Without it, once a search is performed, the original list would be lost, and you wouldn't be able to reset the view back to all shows after a search.

4. **`const [searchTitle, setSearchTitle] = useState("");`**
   - **Purpose:** This state holds the current value of the search input field.
   - **Usage:** It's updated every time the user types into the search input field.
   - **Why Needed:** This state is necessary for controlled components in React. The input field's value is tied to this state, making the input a controlled component. This approach ensures that the input's value is always in sync with the component's state, allowing for more predictable and manageable behavior.

In summary, these states are integral to managing the data, user interactions, and UI of the `ShowsIndex` component. They enable dynamic updating of content based on user actions and API responses, provide error handling capabilities, and ensure controlled behavior of the search input field.

## Why import and use `Link`?

The `Link` component imported from `'react-router-dom'` in the `ShowListing.jsx` component is used for client-side navigation. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

1. **Client-Side Routing:** The `Link` component is part of React Router's declarative routing approach. It enables navigation between different parts of the application without a full page reload, which is typical of traditional web applications. This approach leads to a smoother user experience and faster transitions between views.

2. **Usage in `ShowListing.jsx`:**
   - In your `ShowListing` component, the `Link` is used to wrap the title of the show. This makes the title a clickable element.
   - The `to` prop in the `Link` component specifies the destination path. In your case, it's set to `/shows/${show.id}`, meaning it dynamically creates a URL path based on the `id` of the show.
   - When a user clicks on the show's title, they are navigated to a detailed view of that particular show, presumably a page that provides more information about the show whose `id` is in the URL.

3. **Benefits Over Traditional `<a>` Tags:**
   - Unlike traditional `<a>` tags, which cause a full page reload, `Link` performs navigation within the React application without reloading the entire page. This is more efficient and maintains the application's state.
   - It integrates seamlessly with React Router's routing system, making it easy to manage complex navigation needs in React applications.

In summary, the `Link` component in `ShowListing.jsx` is used to create a user-friendly, efficient, and seamless navigation experience within your React application, allowing users to click on a show's title to view more details about that show.
