`useNavigate` from "react-router-dom" is used as a hook to navigate programmatically in a React application. It is particularly relevant in the context of form submission and handling the response of that submission. Let's break down its usage:

1. **Importing `useNavigate`:** `useNavigate` is imported from "react-router-dom", which is a standard library for routing in React applications.

2. **Creating `navigate` Instance:** Inside the `ShowsForm` component, `const navigate = useNavigate();` creates an instance of `useNavigate`. This instance, `navigate`, can be called to navigate to different routes programmatically.

3. **Using `navigate` in `handleSubmit`:** In the `handleSubmit` function, which is triggered when the form is submitted, a POST request is made to an API. After the API responds successfully, `navigate` is used to redirect the user to a new route. This is seen in the following line:
   
   ```javascript
   navigate(`/shows/${response.id}`);
   ```
   Here, after a show is successfully added (indicated by a successful API response), the user is navigated to a new page that presumably shows the details of the show just added. The `${response.id}` part dynamically constructs the URL using the ID returned from the API response.

In summary, `useNavigate` in both `ShowsNewForm` and `MoviesNewForm` component is used to direct the user to a new page upon successful completion of a form submission. This enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback and navigation to a relevant page, such as a detail view of the item just created.
